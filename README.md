# James Bond Movie Trailers  
We've created a simple website to display all of the James Bond films, the movie posters
and the movie trailers. To browse, run the entertainment_center.py file using Python (version 2.7+).  

The source directory should contain:  

  - fresh_tomatoes.py (contains the HTML and CSS code for the webpage)  
  - media.py (contains the definition of class Movie)  
  - entertainment_center.py (logic for creating the website)  
  - movie_database.csv (all of the movie information)  
  - this README.md file  
  - (optional) fresh_tomatoes.html (this is created when entertainment_center.py is run)  

## Prerequisites  

  1. You must have Python (version 2.7 or higher). All other code runs using functions from Python's
standard library.  
  2. Clone this repository using Git (https://github.com/nickb-/JamesBondMovieTrailers.git)  

## To Run  

  1. Ensure that the directory contains all of the files listed above  
  2. open and / or run entertainment_center.py (using idle or the command line)  
  3. entertainment_center.py should create the fresh_tomatoes.html file. If this doesn't open up 
automatically in our browser, the open manually from this directory.
